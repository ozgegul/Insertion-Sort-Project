[22,27,16,2,18,6] -> Insertion Sort

1. Stages by Sort Type:

  i. [2,27,16,22,18,6]
 ii. [2,6,16,22,18,27]
iii. [2,6,16,18,22,27]

2. Big-O Notation:

n(n+1)/2 = O(nÂ²)

3. Time Complexity: Average case: The number we are looking for is in the middle, Worst case: The number we are looking for is at the end, Best case: The number we are looking for is at the beginning of the series. 

4. "18" is the average case after the array is sorted.

--> Write the first 4 steps of [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] according to Insertion Sort:

    1- [2,3,5,8,7,9,4,15,6]
    2- [2,3,4,8,7,9,5,15,6]
    3- [2,3,4,5,7,9,8,15,6]
    4- [2,3,4,5,6,9,8,15,7]
